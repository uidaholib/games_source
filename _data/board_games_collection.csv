Players try to have the most points at the end of the game by creating beautiful garden paths for their visitors. The deck has 80 cards in ten different colors, with each color featuring a different species of tree; each color has cards numbered 1 through 8, and the number of colors used depends on the number of players. Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile. When the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color. For each color, the player(s) with the highest value of cards in hand of that color scores for a path of trees in her arboretum that begins and ends with that color; a path is a orthogonally adjacent chain of cards with increasing values. For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card. If a player doesn't have the most value for a color, she scores zero points for a path that begins and ends with that color.

On your turn you can play cards from your hand by matching their numbers to any of the face up cards in the center row. You can play one match for each card in the center row. You can also combine two cards from your hand that add up to the number you wish to match. If the card(s) you played match both number and color, you earn the right to place extra cards from your hand in the center row and even force other players to draw cards. Don't forget to yell ""Dos!"" whenever you have two cards in your hand or you could end up drawing more cards! The round ends when one player gets rid of all his cards.

In Freedom: The Underground Railroad, players are working to build up the strength of the Abolitionist movement through the use of notable figures and pivotal events. By raising support for the cause and moving slaves to freedom in Canada, the minds of Americans can be changed and the institution of slavery can be brought down. Freedom is a card-driven, cooperative game for one to four players in which the group is working for the abolitionist movement to help bring an end to slavery in the United States. The players use a combination of cards, which feature figures and events spanning from Early Independence until the Civil War, along with action tokens and the benefits of their role to impact the game. Players need to strike the right balance between freeing slaves from plantations in the south and raising funds which are desperately needed to allow the group to continue their abolitionist activities as well as strengthen the cause. The goal is not easy and in addition to people and events that can have a negative impact on the group's progress, there are also slave catchers roaming the board, reacting to the movements of the slaves on the board and hoping to catch the runaway slaves and send them back to the plantations. Through careful planning and working together, the group might see an end to slavery in their time.",https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119506/freedom-underground-railroad,https://alliance-uidaho.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UID/2vsn7u/alma996466187901851,"Freedom: The Underground Railroad by Brian Mayer Call Number: Board Games Shelf (First Floor) GAME FREEDOM THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD Publication Date: 2013 A challenging cooperative game pitting the players against the institution of slavery during the early 1800's through the Civil War.

Differing combinations of heroes, scenarios, and board configurations offer a lot of replayability. A hero deck and a zombie deck deliver tactical bonuses to each side. Combat is resolved using six-sided dice, modified by the weapon cards with which heroes may be equipped. Many of the cards include zombie movie tropes to achieve a feel of playing out a horror movie.
